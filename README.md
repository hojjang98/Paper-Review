# 📄 Paper Review Notes

This repository is dedicated to reviewing academic papers in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.  
The goal is not just to summarize, but to **critically analyze**, **reconstruct key ideas**, and **explore potential applications or implementations**.

It was created as part of my effort to read academic papers regularly, and to **systematically document my understanding, thoughts, and experiments** based on them.  
Many folders include not just summaries, but also **comparative experiments** or **personal implementations** inspired by the paper's content.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a structured habit of reading and understanding academic papers  
- Translate complex ideas into my own words  
- Re-implement key methods or concepts when possible  
- Strengthen research mindset and prepare for graduate school  
- Test and adapt paper methods to my own datasets and goals

## 🔍 Review Format

Each review typically includes:

- Background and motivation  
- Problem definition and main contributions  
- Explanation of key models or algorithms  
- Analysis of experiments and results  
- Limitations and possible future directions  
- Optional: Personal implementations or variations

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Machine Learning (e.g., ensemble methods, regularization, optimization)  
- Deep Learning (e.g., CNNs, transformers, attention mechanisms)  
- Computer Vision (e.g., pose estimation, action recognition)  
- Applied AI (e.g., healthcare, recommendation systems)

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- 📌 Aim to review at least one paper per week  
- 📌 Include code snippets or full re-implementations when possible  
- 📌 Organize reviews by topic (e.g., CV, NLP, theory)  
- 📌 Conduct small-scale experiments inspired by each paper

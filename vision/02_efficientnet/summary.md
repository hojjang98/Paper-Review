## ✅ Day 1 – Overview & Purpose

### 📌 Abstract Summary
EfficientNet introduces a new family of CNN models that balance accuracy and efficiency by proposing a **compound scaling method**.  
Instead of scaling network depth, width, or resolution arbitrarily, it scales all three dimensions **uniformly** based on a fixed set of coefficients.  
The base model EfficientNet-B0 is discovered using **Neural Architecture Search**, and larger variants (B1–B7) are derived via compound scaling.  

EfficientNet models achieve **state-of-the-art accuracy** with **significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs**, making them ideal for both cloud and edge deployment.

### 📌 Introduction Insights
- Prior CNN models improved accuracy by simply **making networks deeper or wider**, which leads to inefficient computation.  
- EfficientNet solves this by introducing a **principled method** to scale all model dimensions together.  
- Compound scaling maintains a balance across depth, width, and resolution, leading to better accuracy and efficiency.  
- EfficientNet achieves top-1 ImageNet accuracy of **84.4%** with **8.4× fewer FLOPs** and **6.1× fewer parameters** than previous models like GPipe and ResNet.

### 📌 Problem Statement

Most existing scaling methods focus on only **one** dimension:  
- Increase **depth** → may suffer from vanishing gradients  
- Increase **width** → higher memory usage  
- Increase **resolution** → higher computation cost  

There is no systematic rule for scaling them **together**.  
EfficientNet introduces a **compound coefficient φ** and a method to uniformly scale all three using constants (α, β, γ).

### 📌 Core Design Principles

1. **Search for a good baseline (EfficientNet-B0)** using Neural Architecture Search  
2. **Scale it up** with fixed scaling constants:  
   \[
   \text{depth} \propto \alpha^\phi,\quad 
   \text{width} \propto \beta^\phi,\quad 
   \text{resolution} \propto \gamma^\phi
   \]  
3. Maintain resource constraint:  
   \[
   \alpha \cdot \beta^2 \cdot \gamma^2 \approx 2 \quad \text{(to double FLOPs per φ)}
   \]

This leads to a family of EfficientNet-B1 to B7.

### 📌 3-Line Summary

- EfficientNet proposes a **compound scaling method** that balances depth, width, and resolution.  
- It starts from a **NAS-searched baseline (B0)** and scales uniformly for larger variants.  
- The result is a set of models that are both **accurate and lightweight**, outperforming deeper/wider networks with fewer resources.

### 📌 Unfamiliar Terms
- **Compound scaling**: A method to jointly scale multiple model dimensions with a single coefficient φ.  
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: An automated way to design neural networks optimized for accuracy and efficiency.  
- **FLOPs**: Floating Point Operations — a measure of computational cost.

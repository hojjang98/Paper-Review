## âœ… Day 1 â€“ Abstract & Introduction

### ðŸ“Œ Background & Motivation
Deep learningâ€“based object detection has proven effective in agriculture for tasks like crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield estimation.  
However, progress is hindered by:
- **Scarcity of large, well-annotated agricultural datasets**  
- **High cost** and time needed for manual labeling  
- Domain-specific challenges such as subtle visual differences and seasonal variability  

Open-set detectors like **Grounding DINO** can perform **zero-shot detection** via text prompts, but:
- Crafting accurate prompts for agricultural classes is **cumbersome** and **error-prone**  
- Visual variation in crops/weeds is often too subtle for text descriptions to capture well  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Proposed Approach
The authors introduce a **parameter-efficient few-shot adaptation** of Grounding DINO:
- **Remove** the BERT text encoder  
- **Replace** it with **multiple randomly initialized learnable embeddings** per class  
- Keep **all other parameters frozen** during fine-tuning  
- Only the embeddings are updated, enabling adaptation with **minimal training data**  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Key Contributions
1. **Prompt-free adaptation**: Eliminates the need for descriptive text prompts in agricultural object detection  
2. **Few-shot efficiency**: Achieves significant gains over zero-shot detection and full fine-tuning baselines using limited samples  
3. **Cross-domain transferability**: The approach generalizes to other domains such as remote sensing  

---

### ðŸ“Œ High-Level Workflow
1. **Base Model** â€“ Pretrained Grounding DINO  
2. **Architecture Change** â€“ Remove BERT encoder, add per-class learnable embeddings  
3. **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning** â€“ Train only embeddings on small labeled sets  
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Compare against zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and SOTA baselines  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Early Results
- Outperforms zero-shot Grounding DINO by a **large margin**  
- In few-shot settings, achieves up to **24% higher mAP** than fully fine-tuned YOLOv11  
- Improves performance in remote sensing by ~10% over SOTA baselines  

---

### ðŸ“Œ TL;DR Summary
A **lightweight, prompt-free few-shot tuning method** for Grounding DINO that improves agricultural object detection.  
By freezing most of the model and learning only class embeddings, it reduces data requirements and enhances adaptability.

## âœ… Day 2 â€“ Method

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
Adapt a pre-trained **Grounding DINO** for agricultural datasets in a **few-shot** setting by removing the BERT text encoder and replacing it with **randomly initialized learnable embeddings**.  
Only embeddings are trained; all other model parameters remain frozen.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Grounding DINO (Baseline)
- **Image Backbone**: Swin Transformer for hierarchical features  
- **Text Backbone**: BERT encoder for token embeddings  
- **Feature Enhancer**: Self- and cross-attention for imageâ€“text fusion  
- **Cross-Modality Decoder**: Alternating attention layers refine object queries  
- **Losses**: Standard classification + localization losses  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Zero-shot Approach
- Uses pre-trained Grounding DINO **without fine-tuning**  
- Requires manually crafted prompts (e.g., `"crop . weed ."` or `"green pepper . red pepper ."`).  
- Assigns classes by dot-product similarity between token and image features  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Few-shot Approach (Proposed)
- **Remove** BERT encoder â†’ replace with learnable embeddings  
- Operate directly in 768-dim embedding space  
- For \(C\) classes, \(T\) embeddings per class + start/end tokens  
- Only embeddings updated; all other parameters frozen  
- Random initialization works as well as prompt-based initialization  

**Advantages**:  
- Prompt-free (no manual text design)  
- Parameter-efficient (few thousand parameters trained)  
- Low data requirement (as few as 2 labeled images per class)  
- Cross-domain adaptable

## âœ… Day 3 â€“ Experiments & Results

### ðŸ“Œ Experimental Setup
- **Datasets**: Crop/weed detection, fruit counting, insect identification, wheat head detection, PhenoBench  
- **Cross-domain**: Remote sensing datasets  
- **Baselines**: Zero-shot Grounding DINO, fully fine-tuned YOLO, other SOTA methods  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Main Results
- On agricultural datasets: **+24% mAP over YOLO** in few-shot settings  
- On remote sensing: **+10% over SOTA**  
- Zero-shot works in simple settings but struggles in **cluttered/complex environments**; few-shot resolves this  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Effect of Shot Number
- **1-shot**: Sometimes worse than zero-shot (limited coverage)  
- **4/16-shot**: Steady improvement as more labeled samples are added  
- **Instance segmentation (PhenoBench + SAM2)**:  
  - 1-shot reasonable  
  - 8-shot significantly boosts mask mAP

### ðŸ“Œ Summary Table

| Aspect | Zero-shot (Prompt-based) | Few-shot (Proposed) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Data Requirement | Only text prompts | â‰¥2 labeled images per class |
| Prompt Design | Manual, error-prone | Not required |
| Trainable Params | Fixed prompts | Only embeddings |
| Performance | Good in simple cases, weak in complex ones | Significantly higher mAP (up to +24%) |
| Cross-domain | Limited | Validated on remote sensing |

---

### ðŸ“Œ Conclusion (Day 3)
The few-shot embedding adaptation provides **strong improvements** with minimal labeled data.  
It simplifies the pipeline by removing prompt engineering and proves practical in **data-scarce domains** like agriculture and remote sensing.

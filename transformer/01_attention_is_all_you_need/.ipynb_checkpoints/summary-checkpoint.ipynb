    "\n",
    "## âœ… Day 3 â€“ Multi-Head Attention  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Motivation  \n",
    "- A single attention head may capture only one type of relationship.  \n",
    "- Multi-Head Attention allows the model to **jointly attend to information from different subspaces** at different positions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Mechanism (ë…¼ë¬¸ 3.2.2)  \n",
    "- Instead of one attention, project Queries, Keys, and Values **h times** with different learned projections:  \n",
    "  - \\( QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V \\)  \n",
    "- Each head computes Scaled Dot-Product Attention independently:  \n",
    "  - \\( head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) \\)  \n",
    "- Concatenate results of all heads and apply a final linear projection:  \n",
    "  - \\( MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, â€¦, head_h)W^O \\)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Dimensions  \n",
    "- In the paper: \\( h = 8 \\).  \n",
    "- Each head uses \\( d_k = d_v = d_{model}/h = 64 \\).  \n",
    "- This keeps computation cost roughly the same as a single attention function with dimension 512.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Benefits  \n",
    "1. **Diversity**: different heads focus on different aspects (syntax, semantics, positional cues).  \n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: smaller dimensions per head make computations manageable.  \n",
    "3. **Expressiveness**: concatenating multiple heads enriches the final representation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways (Day 3)  \n",
    "- Multi-Head Attention = many scaled dot-product attentions in parallel.  \n",
    "- Enables capturing multiple types of dependencies simultaneously.  \n",
    "- Essential for Transformerâ€™s strong performance.  \n",

    "### ðŸ“Œ Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (ë…¼ë¬¸ 3.3)  \n",
    "- Each encoder and decoder layer includes a **fully connected feed-forward network** after attention.  \n",
    "- Structure:  \n",
    "  - \\( FFN(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2 \\)  \n",
    "- Applied **independently to each position**, but with the same parameters across all positions.  \n",
    "- In the paper:  \n",
    "  - Input/output dimension \\( d_{model} = 512 \\)  \n",
    "  - Inner-layer dimension \\( d_{ff} = 2048 \\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Positional Encoding (ë…¼ë¬¸ 3.5)  \n",
    "- Transformer has no recurrence/convolution â†’ no inherent order information.  \n",
    "- Solution: **Add positional encoding to input embeddings.**  \n",
    "- Defined using sine and cosine functions at varying frequencies:  \n",
    "  - \\( PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\right) \\)  \n",
    "  - \\( PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\\right) \\)  \n",
    "- Added to embeddings:  \n",
    "  - \\( z = embedding + PE \\)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Why sinusoidal?  \n",
    "- Allows extrapolation to sequences longer than those seen during training.  \n",
    "- Provides smooth, continuous encoding of positions.  \n",
    "- Encodes **relative distances** naturally via sine/cosine properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways (Day 4)  \n",
    "1. FFN adds **non-linear transformations** at each position, boosting model capacity.  \n",
    "2. Positional encodings provide **sequence order information** in an attention-only model.  \n",
    "3. Sinusoidal design is simple, parameter-free, and generalizes to unseen lengths.  \n",
